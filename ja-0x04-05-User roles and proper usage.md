== User roles and proper usage ==
Understanding the roles and properly assigning them to users is essential in the segregation of duties process. 

The WordPress roles are:

* Super Admin – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features
* Administrator – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site
* Editor – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users
* Author – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts
* Contributor – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them
* Subscriber – somebody who can only manage their profile

The least privilege principle must be considered when assigning roles. 

A full list of privileges and a comparison between roles is available at http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities.
