== Removal of unused plugins and themes ==
Depending on the server configuration, the files in the WordPress folder can be accessed from the Internet regardless of whether they are used or not. Even if a plugin is disabled, the files are still there and they are accessible from the Internet.

When a new vulnerability is discovered, the attackers write scripts to look for the vulnerable files. Knowing the location of vulnerable plugins increases their chances of infiltrating a vulnerable instance. 

Any plugins and themes that are not actively used must be deleted.
